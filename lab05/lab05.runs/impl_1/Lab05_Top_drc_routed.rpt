2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net AluCtrl/ALUOpOut_reg[1]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin AluCtrl/zero_reg_i_2/O, cell AluCtrl/zero_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net PC/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin PC/ALUOpOut_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell PC/ALUOpOut_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net PC/programCounter_reg[3]_4 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin PC/MemWrite_reg_i_2/O, cell PC/MemWrite_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net PC/programCounter_reg[4]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin PC/immediate_reg[20]_i_2/O, cell PC/immediate_reg[20]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net PC/programCounter_reg[4]_3 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin PC/MemRead_reg_i_2/O, cell PC/MemRead_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net control/ALUOp1_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin control/ALUOp1_reg/L3_2/O, cell control/ALUOp1_reg/L3_2 (in control/ALUOp1_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net control/Branch_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin control/Branch_reg/L3_2/O, cell control/Branch_reg/L3_2 (in control/Branch_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net control/RegWrite_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin control/RegWrite_reg/L3_2/O, cell control/RegWrite_reg/L3_2 (in control/RegWrite_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
