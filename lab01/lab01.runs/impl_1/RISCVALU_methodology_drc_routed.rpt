The same output delay of 0.000 ns has been defined on port 'ALUout[8]' relative to clock virtual_clock for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 3 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
